    <h1> The Mandela Effect </h1>

    <br> </br> The Mandela Effect got its name in 2010 from Fiona Broome after a large amount of people started to believe that Nelson Mandela had died in prison in the 1980s.
    The most popular effect involves the popular children's book and show "The Berenstain Bears." Many people had remembered it as "Berenstein" but this is incorrect.
    It is really spelled "Berenstain." However, in 2016, a reddit user found a VHS tape titled "The Berenstein Bears." This is the most believed theory. </br>
    <br> Other examples of the Mandela Effect include:
    <br> "Mirror mirror on the wall" vs "Magic mirror on the wall"
    <br> "Luke, I am your father" vs "No, I am your father"
    <br> Oscar Meyer vs. Oscar Mayer
