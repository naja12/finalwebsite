    <br> </br> The question of whether Robert Kardashian was actually Khloe's father
    started on an episode of "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" when Khloe questioned
    if she was adopted and Kris proved she was not with a paternity test. OJ and Kris
    were close friends at the time and Kris has admitted to cheating on Robert, however,
    she says it was years before Khloe was born. OJ has agreed to a paternity test.
