    <br> </br> This is one of the most controversial government related conspiracies of all time. It has even been featured on the TV show "Mythbusters."
    This theory states that NASA actually filmed the moon landing on a set in Area 51. It is said that the landing was fake because the flag moved while it was
    being put into the soil, as if there was wind. However, this is impossible in a vacuum. People believe that it may have been made believable with the help
    of Stanley Kubrick, a filmmaker who was familiar with making artificial space sets because of his film "2001: A Space Odessey." There are also said to be
    faults in the direction of their shadows, there are no visible stars, and that it seems the camerawork was operated by another person.
