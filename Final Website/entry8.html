    <br> </br> Stevie Wonder is a popular jazz musician born in 1950. He was born 6 weeks premature and the highly oxygenated incubators of that time
    led to him being blind. Some say that this story is untrue. Evidence against him includes him taking a photo with a Michael Jackson wax statue
    and a video of him catching a mic stand while it was falling.
