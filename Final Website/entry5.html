    <br> </br> It is believed that Michael Jackson was killed by the Iranian government in an attempt
    to cover up the controversy surrounding the second election of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The
    president's opponents declared protests around the country and it became international news.
    Jackson's death became more popular than the protests and disbanded most of the riots.
