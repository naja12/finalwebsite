    <h1> Avril Lavigne Died and has been Replaced </h1>
    <h2> <a href="index.html">Home</a> </h2> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ0Vj5eT33L_nM85VPvjdone4Esp8vt6iQQo-vmWdu3y431es51"style="width: 400px">
    <br> </br> The theory of Avril's death and replacement has been known for years, but has recently been brought to light again through twitter.
    Avril first hired Melissa Vandella as her lookalike for paparazzi and they became best friends. It is said that Avril taught Melissa to sing like her as a joke.
    When Avril's grandfather died in 2003 she became very depressed. It is said that around this time she killed herself. Avril was at the peak of her career and her record
    company did not want to let her go yet. They formally trained Melissa to act like Avril.
    The main evidence is believed to be that "Avril" is missing birthmarks, her jawline has changed, her Canadian accent is gone, her handwriting changed, and her music style has changed from punk to pop. It is also said that there
    are hidden messages in Avril's music. She would also never marry the guy from Nickelback. </br>
