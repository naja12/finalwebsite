    <h1> The "Death" of Tupac </h1>

    <br> </br> After a Mike Tyson fight on September 7, 1996, Tupac was
    shot in the passenger seat of a BMW. Of the 14 bullets that hit Tupac,
    none hit the driver, Suge Knight. Some believe that Suge Knight was Tupac's
    killer. Others believe Tupac faked his death. Many say that Tupac is
    still alive in Cuba living with his step-aunt. Some even think that
    there is photographic proof of him alive to this day.
